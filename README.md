# Find Your Escape

## Description 

Tired of the same old vacations? Looking to get away? Find your escape allows the user to discover new vacation destinations from around the world.  After choosing vacation dates and weather conditions, Find Your Escape uses the data to come up with exciting new vacations. 

The user can interact with the search results by clicking a button in the card for the search result to save the location to their list of favorite locations. The user can review their previously favorited locations by clicking the 'See Favorites' button to retrieve the list of locations they have favorited so far.
