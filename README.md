# Find My Escape

## Description 

This app allows users to find vacation location suggestions based on weather conditions and vacation dates. The user inputs their chosen vacation dates and weather conditions, then the app uses that data to come up with random locations that meet the criteria set by the user for the weather they want based on historical weather in that location. 

The user can interact with the search results by clicking a button in the card for the search result to save the location to their list of favorite locations. The user can review their previously favorited locations by clicking the 'See Favorites' button to retrieve the list of locations they have favorited so far.
